      I build and invest in solutions that move the needle on human
      sustainability, with specific interests in healthcare access and gender
      equality. I’m currently the Chief of Staff at [Capable
      Health](http://www.capablehealth.com).

      My happy place is using — and learning — new technologies *(input)* to
      build consumer-obsessed products *(output)* that do good (*outcome)*: I’ve
      crafted strategies to increase STEM education at [Luminary
      Labs](http://www.luminary-labs.com), stood up an investment fund for the
      gender team at [UNICEF](http://unicef.com), shipped features to improve
      internet security at [Intel](http://www.intel.com), and researched how to
      make our cities more vibrant places to live at [Sidewalk
      Labs](http://www.sidewalklabs.com).

    <div>
      I have a penchant for contemporary art, DIY crafts, vintage lamps, and dim
      sum.
