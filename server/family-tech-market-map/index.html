I make the case for how the traditional nuclear family has given way to different and diverse family models — &ldquo;modern families&rdquo; — and that now’s the right time to build and invest in the Family Tech enabling this paradigm shift. I’ll break down the stages, categories, and companies that are paving the way in Family Tech; and why you should care as a builder or investor. TL DR;</em></p>

<h2 id="the-nuclear-family-is-dead-long-live-the-modern-family">The nuclear family is dead, long live the modern family</h2>
<p>The “nuclear family” was coined by Bronisław Malinowski, considered the father of social anthropology. He argued for the universal centrality of a biological family that looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/nuclear_family_image.jpeg" alt="Quintessential nuclear family"></p>
<p>This term became popularized after World War II as a description of the standard family structure. There was the breadwinner male, his wife who did household chores and looked after the children, and the children themselves. There was an order in which this structure typically took form, too: the man and woman got married, moved in together, had sex, then had children — all before their mid-20s. The nuclear family was the core unit of society well into the 70’s.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>While the family is still the fundamental building block of society, millennials are rewriting the parenting playbook to form modern families. Unlike the nuclear family that had one singular blueprint for the family model, modern families take on many different shapes and forms — from single-parent and childless families, to same-sex couples and parents raising transgender kids.</p>
<p>The modern family seeks agency: Women, individuals and parents want to have the power to choose whether to have kids, how and where to give birth, where to go for flexible child care&hellip; (To butcher Tolstoy, “All nuclear families are alike; each modern family is modern in their own way.”)</p>
<p>With this paradigm shift in the family model, the healthcare and caregiving solutions have shifted as well to be more individualized, specialized, and personalized. You’re seeing it already. If you’re not ready for kids just yet, you can get contraceptives prescribed and delivered online. If you’re deciding on a home birth, you can sign up for a virtual consult with a midwife to walk you through options. If an urgent meeting comes up and you need child care ASAP, you can search through a child care marketplace for open spots at a center nearby.</p>
<p><strong>There’s an outsized opportunity to build and invest in this new wave of tech-enabled products and services that give individuals and parents the agency to care for their modern families. This market is called Family Tech, a <a href="https://www.betterventures.io/post/6-trends-not-to-miss-as-parent-tech-founder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$46B</a> and growing opportunity.</strong></p>

<h2 id="mapping-out-the-46b-family-tech-opportunity">Mapping out the $46B Family Tech opportunity</h2>
<p>Family Tech is not just a big opportunity; it&rsquo;s one that’s deeply personal to me.</p>
<p>I’m lucky enough to have met and partnered with incredible Family Tech founders and builders through my work, as the Chief of Staff at <a href="http://www.capablehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capable Health</a> where we provide the software infrastructure for modern (family) care delivery, and as a Venture Fellow at <a href="http://www.susaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susa Ventures</a> where we back exceptional Family Tech founders. I’m also a millennial woman who’s starting to assess her own family planning options.</p>
<p>To understand the opportunity as it is today, I’ve mapped out the Family Tech market across four stages of parenting: family planning, child bearing, child rearing, and child launching. I’ll identify the categories and companies that are paving the way in each, and why builders and investors should care.</p>
<p>But firstly, you may be asking the age-old question, “Why now?” There are four major tailwinds that’re enabling the paradigm shift towards the modern family and Family Tech:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>There are more Americans then ever who’re making (or about to make) family planning decisions.</strong> Millennials (ages 26 to 41) represent America’s largest generation. They also happen to be the target demographic for Family Tech, as they’re both digitally savvy and of reproductive age. Right after Millennials come Gen Zs (ages 10 to 25), and together, they bring a new set of considerations to the modern family, ranging from <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/millennials-and-generation-z-members-are-going-public-with-their-reluctance-to-have-children-01662499330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change to student debt</a>. That’s new opportunity to build Family Tech for these generations’ unique pain points and perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumers have adopted tech en masse and have higher standards for care than ever.</strong> Let’s face it, we’re hooked to our smartphones. Spurred on by the pandemic where we saw a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/telehealth-pandemic-how-has-it-changed-health-care-delivery-medicaid-and-medicare#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20the%20number,GAO%27s%20Medicaid%20expert%2C%20Carolyn%20Yocom." target="_blank" rel="noopener">15x increase</a> in the usage of telehealth services, consumers now expect virtual-first care that’s personalized, convenient, and high-touch. Consumers are more open than ever about adopting Family Tech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government agendas are shining a spotlight on reproductive, maternal and child care rights.</strong> All big trends in healthcare are driven by legislation and regulation, and Family Tech is no different. Notably, the Dobbs decision has created <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2022/06/30/dobbs-another-frontline-for-health-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an urgent need</a> for access to reproductive health care. CMS has been pushing states to provide postpartum coverage to people enrolled in <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/medicaid-policies-fuel-disparities-in-timely-prenatal-care-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicaid and CHIP</a>. And while it ultimately failed to pass, the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act promised to cap child care costs at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7% of families’ income</a>. Government agendas have spotlighted white space opportunities for the modern family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Family Tech rides on the tailwinds of women’s health investments.</strong> “FemTech” is a well-trodden, buzzworthy <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/05/10/2439959/0/en/Global-Women-s-Health-Market-was-valued-at-38-billion-in-2021-and-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-over-4-5-to-cross-47-billion-by-2026.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$38B</a> market with unicorns like Maven Clinic and Tia as shining exemplars of why invest in the space. Investors already have their checkbooks open for women’s health companies, deploying <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/femtech-startups-nearly-double-funding-dollars-last-year-still-make-small-percent-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3B</a> in funding last year, and have authored comprehensive theses including <a href="https://m13.co/article/how-femtech-innovations-can-help-break-taboos-around-womens-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> by Winnie Lau for M13 and <a href="https://rockhealth.com/insights/building-comprehensive-women-digital-health-eight-sectors-serving-women-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> by Rock Health. Family Tech is deeply intertwined with women’s health innovations given the important role women have as the child bearer and oftentimes primary caregiver. The buzz around FemTech has opened the door for Family Tech, too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s jump into the first stage of parenting…</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="family-planning">Family planning</h3>
<p><img src="/img/family_planning_market_map.png" alt="Family planning market map"></p>
<p>The modern family starts out with family planning. Whether single or in a relationship, individuals are looking to plan out and control how many children they want (if any) and when they have them.</p>
<p><em>Why you should care:</em> There are more millennial women of childbearing age in the U.S. than ever. Yet, birth and fertility rates are at an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44151642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all time low</a> and the median age of women giving birth has been pushed back to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/motherhood-deferred-us-median-age-giving-birth-hits-30-rcna27827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 years old</a>, a record high. Turns out, women and millennials are choosing to focus on their careers and education and delaying childbirth. Families also look physically different than they used to, with single individuals and same-sex couples wanting the options to have children.</p>
<p>This has fueled new technologies that capture and surface insights to make informed family planning decisions, prevent or increase the chances of pregnancy affordably and accessibly, open up alternative pathways to having a child, and provide longitudinal support through the end-to-end fertility journey.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.evicore.com/insights/next-for-the-fertility-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8B</a> fertility market is one of the most active spaces in Family Tech, receiving <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/fertility-support-startups-banked-345m-funding-2021-heres-why-workplace-perk-becoming#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20fertility%20support%20startups,fund%20dedicated%20to%20digital%20health." target="_blank" rel="noopener">$345M</a> of VC funding in 2021 alone.</p>

<h3 id="child-bearing">Child bearing</h3>
<p><img src="/img/child_bearing_market_map.png" alt="Child bearing market map"></p>
<p>Congrats, you’re pregnant! The pregnancy and postpartum period, which averages 40 weeks and 6 weeks respectively, is when the expecting parents carry and give birth.</p>
<p><em>Why you should care:</em> There’s a maternity care ‘desert,’ where <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/a-third-of-us-counties-a-maternity-care-access-desert#:~:text=Overall%2C%2036%20percent%20of%20US,born%20in%20maternity%20care%20deserts." target="_blank" rel="noopener">36% of U.S. counties</a> have no obstetric hospitals or birth centers, and no obstetric providers. Combined with women giving birth later in life correlating with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-age-complications/severe-birth-complications-more-common-with-older-mothers-idUSKBN18Q28T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more severe</a> birth complications, there’s been an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/health/us-women-health-care/index.html#:~:text=The%20US%20had%20the%20highest,deaths%20per%20100%2C000%20live%20births." target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase in maternal deaths in the U.S.</a> An even more sobering stat is the disproportionate effects this has on racial and ethnic minorities: the maternal mortality rate was double amongst Black women.</p>
<p>There are critical gaps that Family Tech can help fill around longitudinal care, support and education to improve the physical, mental and emotional health of expecting parents.</p>
<p>In the U.S., maternal and infant health care is a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/business/mahmee-goldman-sachs-maternal-health/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1667975929376117&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ApIfPBRKSxMKTxar0w-cu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$160B industry</a> with billions of dollars yet to be unlocked.</p>

<p>Taking care of your child from infancy to adolescence — the ages of 1 to 12 years old — is the next big mountain to climb. It&rsquo;s the critical period in a child&rsquo;s development where they take their first steps, learn to speak, start school, and inevitably have many checkups with the pediatrician.</p>

<p><img src="/img/child_launching_market_map.png" alt="Child launching market map"></p>
<p>From the ages of 12 to 25, you’re helping your child transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Adolescents are going through puberty, explore their own identity and seeking autonomy. Often, this means that a parent&rsquo;s role goes from being the primary decision maker for care decisions, to being a supportive guide and safety net as their child becomes fully independent.</p>
<p><em>Why you should care:</em> Adolescence is a critical coming-of-age period, and one that is often overlooked because of taboo and stigma. There are <a href="https://opa.hhs.gov/adolescent-health/adolescent-health-facts/americas-diverse-adolescents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42M</a> adolescents in the U.S., and amongst them, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-11-09/us-adolescents-are-getting-less-sex-education-now-than-25-years-ago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only half</a> are receiving sex education that meet national standards, <a href="https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/05/03/american-teens-are-experiencing-a-rise-in-mental-health-disorders-suicidal-thoughts/#:~:text=From%202007%20to%202019%2C%20the,to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center." target="_blank" rel="noopener">13%</a> have a major depressive episode, and adolescents and young adults make up <a href="https://www.eatingdisordercenter.org/facts-figures/#:~:text=95%25%20of%20those%20who%20have,with%20eating%20disorders%20receive%20treatment." target="_blank" rel="noopener">95%</a> of people with eating disorders. As they explore different roles and attitudes, this also is a critical time to establish their identities. On gender identity, adolescents represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/science/transgender-teenagers-national-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43%</a> of the trangender population.</p>
<p>Child launching innovations provide adolescents — and their parents as guardians and supporters — with high-touch services and information to take care of their whole self: from mental and behavioral health, to sexual and physical health. These Gen Zs are digital natives, so the bar is high for bold brands and delightful mobile-first experiences.</p>
<p>While still nascent compared to the other stages, investors are starting to take notice: digital behavioral health tools for children and teenagers raked in <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/31/digital-mental-health-children-teens-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$919M</a> of funding in 2021, up from $51M in 2017 (that’s 17x).</p>

<p>While the nuclear family is dead, the modern family is thriving.</p>
