  <section class="post-content"><p>Climate change seems like a far distant issue… until it shows up in your backyard.</p>
<p>That’s what happened a week ago, in mine.</p>
<p>My Instagram stories were filled with New York City covered in a hazy orange smog, selfies taken in N95s, and screenshots of the AQI going up and up (at one point, we had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/06/07/canada-wildfires-smoke-air-quality-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the worst</a> air quality in the world). Friends in group chats were voicing their immediate discomfort from the soot and dust: hacking coughs, itchy eyes, queasy nausea. What they missed were the longer term effects of pollution: increased asthma, bronchitis, and heart failure. (And a look outside my apartment window made me realize that I was one of the lucky ones, privileged to be WFH and with an air purifier on blast.)</p>
<p>The culprit of Smog-geddon NYC 2023 was smoke from wildfires up north that had drifted over, an increasingly “normal” event as our planet warms up, heating our atmosphere and drying out vegetation. And it perfectly encapsulates a topic I’ve been making sense of over the past few months: climate change and our health. <strong>The climate crisis is our most existential health crisis, and the U.S. healthcare industry is an outsized contributor to our climate woes…</strong></p>
<p>Why aren’t we — as startup builders, corporate leaders, and investors — talking about it more, let alone putting our “innovator” hats on to find new solutions to these big thorny problems?</p>
<p>I’m here to share my learnings going down the rabbit hole, on why we need to accelerate climate action in healthcare. This post covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#the-compounding-problem">The compounding problem: How our health impacts our climate, and how our climate impacts our health</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-we-can-be-doing">What we can be doing to accelerate climate action in healthcare</a></li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-compounding-problem">The compounding problem: How our health impacts our climate, and how our climate impacts our health</h2>
<p>The ginormous problems — and opportunities — at the nexus of healthcare and climate change is best exemplified by the illustration below, courtesy of my physician-innovator friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chethan-sarabu-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chethan Sarabu</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/img/climate_health_diagram.jpg" alt="Climate and health diagram"></p>
<p>And it can be further simplified into two buckets: adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<h3 id="adaptation-how-our-climate-impacts-our-health">Adaptation: How our climate impacts our health</h3>
<p>Climate change has drastic impacts on our individual health, through social determinants like clean air, safe drinking water, food and shelter. Rising temperatures have led to an increase in vector-borne diseases, respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses&hellip; <a href="https://noharm-global.org/sites/default/files/documents-files/5961/HealthCaresClimateFootprint_092319.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the list goes on</a>.</p>
<p>Americans are experiencing it today. <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/climate-change-and-asthma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thousands of children</a> die prematurely each year from lower respiratory infections caused by air pollution from burning fossil fuels. With warming temperatures, the increased geographic range for ticks has led to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/media/lyme-tickborne-diseases-increasing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a doubling of Lyme disease cases</a> since 2000. And as I’m typing this up at my local coffee shop patio, my sneezes are a testament to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/climate-change-allergy-season-pollen-adults-rcna81227" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased pollen counts</a> and worsened allergies.</p>
<p>As we get sicker, climate change is disrupting access to healthcare services. A majority of health systems have been affected by climate-related events such as wildfires or hurricanes over the past five years, with one health system citing <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/extreme-weather-derailing-healthcare-delivery-across-country-providers-tell-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$22 million in damages</a> following a single extreme weather event.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, the irony is that already underserved and marginalized communities — people of color, low-income people, rural communities — who’re least equipped to manage and recover from climate change are the most impacted.</p>
<p>Working towards an equitable and accessible healthcare sector that betters our individual health means adapting to our changing climate.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="mitigation-how-our-health-impacts-our-climate">Mitigation: How our health impacts our climate</h3>
<p>But where does greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the cause of climate change, come from? Turns out, a big chunk comes from the U.S. healthcare sector.</p>
<p>For those who’re just starting their climate journey, you might be wondering, “How the heck are GHG emissions calculated?” Globally, the agreed-upon standard for how orgs measure emissions is set by the <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a>, which categorizes emissions into three scopes. Let’s apply the scopes to <a href="https://practicegreenhealth.org/tools-and-resources/scope-3-ghg-emissions-accounting-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a health system’s emissions</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/img/health_system_emissions.png" alt="A health system&amp;rsquo;s emissions"></p>
<ul>
<li>Scope 1 are direct emissions from healthcare facilities, such as from on-site boilers and certain medical gases,</li>
<li>Scope 2 are indirect emissions through purchased electricity, and</li>
<li>Scope 3 are indirect emissions across the supply chain and other sources (often dubbed “the iceberg beneath the surface&quot; since it makes up ~80% of emissions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet#:~:text=Historical%20NHE%2C%202021%3A,Gross%20Domestic%20Product%20%28GDP%29." target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.1 trillion</a> healthcare sector (that’s <a href="https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet#:~:text=Historical%20NHE%2C%202021%3A,Gross%20Domestic%20Product%20%28GDP%29." target="_blank" rel="noopener">18.3% of our GDP!</a>) accounts for 10% of emissions in the U.S. That’s across health systems, clinics, payers, medical suppliers, biopharmas, and public health departments. We can have an outsized impact on the economy by using our healthcare sector’s purchasing power to drive the transition to clean energy and a low-carbon supply chain across the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/27/health-care-hospitals-climate-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zooming out globally</a>, while our healthcare system treats just 4% of the world’s population, it’s the most polluting system in the world accounting for <a href="https://noharm-global.org/sites/default/files/documents-files/5961/HealthCaresClimateFootprint_092319.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27% of all healthcare emissions</a> worldwide. Decarbonizing the U.S. healthcare sector would also be a huge driver for decarbonizing globally.</p>
<p>Solving for climate change won&rsquo;t happen without decarbonizing our healthcare sector.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-we-can-be-doing">What we can be doing to accelerate climate action in healthcare</h2>
<p>To quote Michael E. Porter (of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our favorite consulting framework</a>), “The effects of climate change on companies’ operations are now so tangible and certain that the issue is best addressed with the tools of <em>the strategist</em>, not the philanthropist.” So much so, that the tools to combat climate change represent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhTFno6qEvw&amp;ab_channel=WeDon%27tHaveTime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$75 trillion</a> in business opportunities in the coming years!</p>
<p>I see startup builders, corporate leaders, and investors playing three main roles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bringing existing ClimateTech solutions to healthcare.</strong> There’s tons of investments happening in ClimateTech (in fact, it seems like a recession-proof industry, raking in <a href="https://www.holoniq.com/notes/2022-climate-tech-vc-funding-totals-70-1b-up-89-from-37-0b-in-2021#:~:text=Become%20a%20Client-,Defying%20gravity%2C%202022%20Climate%20Tech%20VC%20funding%20totals%20%2470.1B,nearly%20double%202021%27s%20record%20total." target="_blank" rel="noopener">$70.1 billion in venture dollars last year</a>, but if you look to the unicorns being built in carbon accounting and energy transition, they&rsquo;re selling into “sexy” sectors like finance, retail and tech. We need to help ClimateTech companies cross the go-to-market chasm into healthcare.</li>
<li><strong>Baking climate action into every healthcare company</strong>, to help leaders actively prepare for and mitigate their emissions. Healthcare leaders, who’ve been rapidly making climate commitments (<em>see <a href="#why-now">Why now</a></em>), should have emission reduction targets embedded into their company&rsquo;s strategy and operations.</li>
<li><strong>Creating new solutions purpose-built for healthcare</strong>. Healthcare&rsquo;s complex value chain has unique opportunities, like reducing emissions from medical gases. Given that speed of execution is needed to meet climate goals and is a startup’s bread and butter, I’m stoked to champion founders journeying down this path.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if you’re a cynic like me, you’re thinking, our healthcare sector’s still reeling from the aftermaths of COVID-19 and has more immediate and pressing fish to fry in its quest to innovate. <a href="https://bettychang.xyz/advice-for-digital-health-founders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The business case for a healthcare org</a> is driving financial and patient health outcomes; <em>not</em> our planet’s health.</p>
<p>My lightbulb moment was realizing that the climate opportunity <em>is</em>, in fact, in line with a healthcare org’s business case. In fact, it supports it. When you look at the <a href="https://sustainablehealthcare.org.uk/sites/default/files/csh_report_2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principles for sustainable healthcare</a>, it maps neatly into the overarching goals of a healthcare org, dubbed the <a href="https://www.chartspan.com/blog/the-triple-aim-of-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Quadruple Aim”</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/img/climate_mapping_healthcare_and_sustainability_goals.png" alt="Mapping healthcare and sustainable goals"></p>
<p>Instead of thinking about climate action in healthcare as its own separate problem to solve for, we should be reframing it as helping accelerate the existing clinical and financial goals of healthcare orgs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-now">Why now: Money, regulation, and stakeholder pressure</h2>
<p>There’s three things that get an org to take climate seriously: (a) financial incentives, (b) sector-level regulatory requirements, (c) stakeholder pressure. The healthcare sector is finally feeling the heat on all three.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="a-financial-incentives">A. Financial incentives</h3>
<p>Governments are pushing orgs towards energy reduction by providing tax incentives, loans, and grants. Under Biden’s Inflation Reducation Act, <a href="https://www.mwe.com/events/hospitals-renewable-energy-new-financial-incentives-opportunities-in-the-inflation-reduction-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospitals are able to tap into</a> the single largest investment in climate and energy in U.S. history, including <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inflation&#43;reduction&#43;act&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS914US914&amp;oq=inflation&#43;reduction&#43;act&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0i512j0i20i263i512j0i512j69i60l3.2528j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$250 billion</a> to switching over to clean energy. And states have also been rolling out their own incentive programs.</p>
<p>Where governments have yet to formalize incentives, healthcare orgs are voluntarily filling in the gaps. One progressive health system I talked to tied executive bonuses to hitting certain GHG reduction targets.</p>
</br>
<h3 id="b-sector-level-regulatory-requirements">B. Sector-level regulatory requirements</h3>
<p>Commitments are finally happening in droves. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/11/10/hhs-shares-health-sector-emissions-reduction-climate-resilience-announcements-at-cop27.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100+ healthcare orgs</a> representing 800+ hospitals have signed on to a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/04/22/hhs-launches-pledge-initiative-mobilize-health-care-sector-reduce-emissions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House and HHS initiative</a> for orgs to halve GHG emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. And you know the government is serious when they form an entirely new office, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ash/ocche/index.html#:~:text=The%20Office%20of%20Climate%20Change%20and%20Health%20Equity%20addresses%20the,to%20address%20this%20growing%20issue." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity</a>, with its whole mandate being to help decarbonize the health care industry.</p>
<p>To help orgs meet those commitments, the Joint Commission, the nation&rsquo;s oldest and largest standards-setting and accrediting body, is coming out with <a href="https://www.jointcommission.org/resources/news-and-multimedia/newsletters/newsletters/joint-commission-online/march-22-2023/comment-on-proposed-new-requirements-to-address-environmental-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stringent environmental standards</a> in July 2023. While currently positioned as recommendations, orgs should be reading the tea leaves that environmental regulations tied to funding will become mandatory in the near future.</p>
</br>
<h3 id="c-stakeholder-pressure">C. Stakeholder pressure</h3>
<p>Respected non-profits and governmental agencies like <a href="https://noharm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthcare Without Harm</a>, <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/news/blog/ahrqviews/healthcare-climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a>, and <a href="https://nam.edu/programs/climate-change-and-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the National Academy of Medicine</a>, are putting pressure on healthcare leadership. <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.22.0052" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Around 90%</a> of execs surveyed said that implementing climate mitigation and resilience strategies was an important priority.</p>
<p>Bottom-up, healthcare professionals are finding scrappy, clever ways to reduce the footprints of their own pathways while holding employers accountable. Anaesthesiologists are making the case to switch <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-doctor-anesthesiology-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from desflurane to sevoflurane</a> in the operating room, an alternative anaesthetic gas that is 20 times less potent as a GHG. Facilities managers are implementing <a href="https://mmheadlines.org/2023/04/medical-plastics-recycling-initiative-ramps-up-at-u-m-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycling programs</a> to sustainably dispose of medical plastics, which make up 25% of all hospital waste. And <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/connecting-climate-change-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professors are embedding</a> climate change’s impact on health into the academic curriculum.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whitespaces">Whitespaces for climate X health solutions</h2>
<p>Hopefully I’ve convinced you of the problem and opportunity, and your mind’s flitting to solutions.</p>
<p>I wish I had a crystal ball. Instead, I have six whitespaces where I see impactful solutions can be applied or built:</p>
<p><img src="/img/climatecare_marketmap.png" alt="Climate&amp;rsquo;s impact on our health"></p>
<h3 id="opportunity-1-how-can-we-help-healthcare-orgs-account-for-and-report-on-their-ghg-emissions-in-real-time">Opportunity #1: How can we help healthcare orgs account for and report on their GHG emissions, in real-time?</h3>
<p>To commit to science-based targets and track progress towards them, healthcare orgs need to be able to calculate their emissions across their organization. It’s not negotiable. <a href="https://cleanenergyfinanceforum.com/2023/04/28/explainer-what-does-carbon-accounting-add-up-to-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbon accounting is the catalyst</a> to a cascading of decarbonization strategies.</p>
<p>The global carbon accounting software market is worth <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/carbon-accounting-software-market-107292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12.7 billion</a> with verticalized incumbents staking their claim: <a href="https://watershed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watershed</a> serves tech companies, <a href="https://persefoni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persefoni</a> has become the darling of financial firms, and <a href="https://carboncloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CarbonCloud</a> leads in the food sector. Yet, there’s no solution that’s designed for the healthcare value chain.</p>
<p><em>A case study: A health system I chatted to had the best carbon accounting solution I’d seen to date… in Excel. They spent 3+ years building it from scratch because “no off-the-shelf tools exist,” integrating datasets across their EHR and account payables, ​generating heatmaps and visualization, and surfacing recommended actions. If you added up all the hours and resources that internal team members put it, it’d be (at a minimum) $500k+ to create and $100k+ yearly to maintain. Imagine the savings and standardization from purchasing an off-the-shelf carbon accounting software for healthcare.</em></p>
<br/>
<h3 id="opportunity-2-how-can-we-forecast-and-predict-for-how-climate-related-events-will-impact-care-delivery-and-our-individual-health">Opportunity #2: How can we forecast and predict for how climate-related events will impact care delivery and our individual health?</h3>
<p>In a single year, ten climate-related events were estimated to cost the U.S. <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals-health-systems/report-climate-changes-costing-u-s-billions-health-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 billion</a>. That includes costs associated with 917 deaths, 20,568 hospitalizations, 17,857 emergency room visits, and countless supply chain disruptions. As weather-related emergencies increase, there are also dire costs for hospitals in ensuring that they can stay open and that patients can access the healthcare they need.</p>
<p>Predictive analytics solutions raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/clean-tech-and-energy/climate-predictions-startups-funding-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$267 million</a> in funding last year to help orgs and consumers (you guessed it) predict for future trends and scenarios, assess and manage risk, and make better decisions. Verticalized incumbents have proven out this model in other industries, with <a href="https://climate.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClimateAi</a> helping farmers plant crops for increased yield, <a href="https://www.nnergix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nnergix</a> helping planners configure solar panels for maximum energy gain, and <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Concern</a> helping property developers understand the financial impact of climate-related risks to their buildings.</p>
<p>There’s abundant healthcare data that can help public health departments predict the next outbreaks, procurement and emergency preparedness leads predict for the next disruptions, facilities managers plan for their next capital investments. Not to mention, the AI advances and hype to make it a reality.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="opportunity-3-how-can-we-manage-energy-consumption-to-meet-building-codes-and-standards-while-cashing-in-on-financial-incentives">Opportunity #3: How can we manage energy consumption to meet building codes and standards, while cashing in on financial incentives?</h3>
<p>Healthcare orgs are intensive services businesses, consuming close to <a href="https://practicegreenhealth.org/topics/energy/energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of the total energy</a> used in U.S. commercial buildings and spending more than $8 billion on energy every year. With 5,000+ registered hospitals in the U.S. and almost a million staffed beds running 24/7, hospitals consume <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/case-study-lowering-health-care-costs-through-energy-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.5x as much energy</a> as office buildings and emit 2.5x  as much carbon dioxide. And that’s not counting additional facilities like research labs, administrative offices, and satellite clinics.</p>
<p>Reducing energy consumption and transitioning to more efficient alternatives is low hanging fruit that directly impact Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Small fixes like upgrading grading lighting to more efficient LED fixtures and installing motion sensors to turn off lights in unoccupied areas go a long way. There’s also longer-term ROI projects of switching existing buildings to renewable energy sources that don’t rely on fossil fuels, and designing new construction sustainably from the ground up (the average hospital spends $10 million per year on new construction!). Energy improvements can be expensive, but the savings on monthly energy bills and some extra padding from government credits/rebates can be impressive.</p>
<p><em>A case study: <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/hospitals-race-save-patients-and-planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cleveland Clinic</a>, which has 15 LEED certified buildings, has reduced its energy use intensity by 19%, leading to $50 million in savings. About one-third of the savings have come from small operating room improvements, e.g., a small reduction of air exchanges (used to keep the air clean) from 20 times an hour to six when ORs aren’t in use led to $2 million in savings a year.</em></p>
<br/>
<h3 id="opportunity-4-how-can-we-create-a-transparent-resilient-supply-chain-for-healthcare-orgs-to-purchase-the-optimal-supplies-while-reducing-waste">Opportunity #4: How can we create a transparent, resilient supply chain for healthcare orgs to purchase the optimal supplies, while reducing waste?</h3>
<p>Healthcare is one of the largest waste-producing sectors in the U.S. When you break down where emissions come from in a health system, <a href="https://greenhealthcarewaste.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sustainable-Procurement-in-Health-Care-Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 to 80%</a> are embedded in the products and services that we buy. Hospital patients generate roughly 34 pounds of waste each day, which leads to 6 million tonnes of waste annually. And much of this waste is coming from medical supplies that are in perfect, usable condition and put out in the trash by health care facilities, which adds up to an estimated <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthcare-of-tomorrow/articles/2017-03-09/hospitals-are-wasting-billions-of-dollars-worth-of-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$765 billion a year</a>.</p>
<p>Healthcare orgs could save billions per year by streamlining supply chain operations, and it’s become a clear priority for investments by execs: the supply chain function oversees most of a health system’s external spend, accounting for <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/optimizing-health-system-supply-chain-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of total costs</a>. For every $1 invested into the supply chain, a hospital could make <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/finance/hospitals-could-save-billions-by-optimizing-their-supply-chains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 to $4 back</a>.</p>
<p>A clearly needed solution here is the analytics that serves as the backbone of a well-run supply chain. With procurement data, there’s no way to really compare and “shop” for medical supplies easily, let alone identify the environmental impact of products. And downstream, with clinician-level utilization data, there’s a need for optimizing the type and frequency of purchases to avoid future disruptions, reduce waste, and improve margins. The lack of clean, accessible data is made worse by data siloes within healthcare orgs as more M&amp;A happens up top. I’m giddy to learn of anyone solving for this.</p>
<p><em>A case study: <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/healthcare/kaiser-permanente-launches-sustainability-scorecard-for-medical-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Permanente</a> implemented their Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) program and Scorecard to better evaluate and select products that do not contain harmful chemicals, while also encouraging suppliers to offer more sustainable supplies. In its first year, the program was estimated to save the org $26 million.</em></p>

<h3 id="opportunity-5-how-can-we-figure-out-the-environmental-impact-of-healthcare-products-and-services-and-develop-sustainable-alternatives-where-needed">Opportunity #5: How can we figure out the environmental impact of healthcare products and services, and develop sustainable alternatives where needed?</h3>
<p>A key ingredient to procuring sustainable products and services, is that these sustainable alternatives exist in the first place. There’s still tons of whitespace when it comes to measuring the environmental impact of healthcare products and services.</p>
<p>We automatically think to packaging and shipping existing products, so there’s less waste. For example, <a href="https://cabinethealth.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cabinet Health</a> is working to eliminate single-use plastic in medicine through its refillable medicine containers. But there’s also the non-obvious R&amp;D to validate what products and services are better for our planet: Does switching from in-person to telehealth visits actually net out to less GHG emissions in the long run? What&rsquo;s the least potent anaesthetic gas, that&rsquo;s still cost and clinically effective?</p>
<p>And if not, let&rsquo;s develop more sustainable alternatives where there are gaps.</p>
<p><em>Pharma companies and health systems are developing low-emission alternatives to metered-dose inhalers, which make up <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2023/hidden-contributor-climate-change-asthma-inhalers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of inhalers in the U.S.</a> The active propellent, hydrofluoroalkanes, that administers the inhalers have the equivalent emissions impact of driving half a million cars for a year (1,000x the global warming potential of carbon dioxide!).</em></p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-get-from-talk-to-action">How can we get from talk to action?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheesy to say. Accelerating climate action within our healthcare sector is a yesterday problem. If we ignore it today, we&rsquo;re committing ourselves to an irreversible path.</p>
<p>If you’re a fellow builder, investor or explorer in this space, I want to hear from you. What opportunities do you see? What are you working on? What do you agree (and adamantly disagree) with?</p>
<p>Shoot me an email or message me on Twitter.</p>
