  <section class="post-content"><p>Welcome to healthtech!</p>
<p>You’re a founder, operator, or investor who’s new to the industry and figuring out where to start. Let’s face it, working in U.S. healthcare is ridiculously rewarding. But it&rsquo;s also compliance-ridden, complex, and can be frustratingly opaque and lonely to navigate.</p>
<p>Over the past year working at <a href="www.capablehealth.com">Capable Health</a>, I&rsquo;d attribute quite a few wins to stepping into helpful communities chock-full of connections, tools and insights: I learned to make sense of APIs, EHRs, ONC and FHIR from reading <a href="https://www.outofpocket.health/p/how-to-integrate-into-an-emr-and-why-epic-won-with-brendan-keeler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Out-Of-Pocket</a>, I met incredible founders — a few who became our earliest customers and many who’ve become friends — through <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>, co-organized my first happy hour with <a href="https://peppernyc.umso.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pepper</a>…</p>
<p>I’ve compiled a guide of healthtech communities and resources from community leaders that I’ve loved and rely on, alongside a bunch more crowdsourced from friends. I hope it’s a helpful starting point in pinpointing and sorting through the right communities for you.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Health Tech Nerds</strong><br>
<em>What is it:</em> A private Slack community with 3,500+ healthtech nerds discussing news, trading notes and networking to support each other. Membership is $20/mo or $200/yr membership.<br>
<em>Why I love it:</em> I used to not believe in paying for community until HTN. It’s self-selected for people who are serious about healthcare and probably the most engaged online community there is.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PMs in Healthcare</strong>    <br>
<em>What is it:</em> A Slack community with 1,000+ of the brightest product minds in healthcare across startups, growth-stage companies, and health systems. There are channels for tech stack discussions, for PM job seekers, and by cities.   <br>
<em>Why I love it:</em> If I ever have a product question, chances are someone in this community has asked it already, e.g., buy vs. build, what vendors to use for scheduling, getting HIPAA-compliant. A must for care delivery providers who don’t want to reinvent the wheel on their tech stack.  <br>
Stay tuned, application link coming soon.</p>

Meet ups include happy hour and roundtable conversation on big topics like how to sell into healthtech orgs through channel partnerships. <br>
