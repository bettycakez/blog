Welcome to healthtech! 

You’re a founder, operator, or investor who’s new to the industry and figuring out where to start. Let’s face it, working in U.S. healthcare is ridiculously rewarding. But it's also compliance-ridden, complex, and can be frustratingly opaque and lonely to navigate. 

Over the past year working at [Capable Health](www.capablehealth.com), I'd attribute quite a few wins to stepping into helpful communities chock-full of connections, tools and insights: I learned to make sense of APIs, EHRs, ONC and FHIR from reading [Out-Of-Pocket](https://www.outofpocket.health/p/how-to-integrate-into-an-emr-and-why-epic-won-with-brendan-keeler), I met incredible founders — a few who became our earliest customers and many who’ve become friends — through [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/), co-organized my first happy hour with [Pepper](https://peppernyc.umso.co/)…

I’ve compiled a guide of healthtech communities and resources from community leaders that I’ve loved and rely on, alongside a bunch more crowdsourced from friends. I hope it’s a helpful starting point in pinpointing and sorting through the right communities for you.

## Online connections
1. **Health Tech Nerds**   
*What is it:* A private Slack community with 3,500+ healthtech nerds discussing news, trading notes and networking to support each other. Membership is $20/mo or $200/yr membership.  
*Why I love it:* I used to not believe in paying for community until HTN. It’s self-selected for people who are serious about healthcare and probably the most engaged online community there is.   
[Become a member](https://www.healthtechnerds.com/pricing).   

2. **PMs in Healthcare**       
*What is it:* A Slack community with 1,000+ of the brightest product minds in healthcare across startups, growth-stage companies, and health systems. There are channels for tech stack discussions, for PM job seekers, and by cities.      
*Why I love it:* If I ever have a product question, chances are someone in this community has asked it already, e.g., buy vs. build, what vendors to use for scheduling, getting HIPAA-compliant. A must for care delivery providers who don’t want to reinvent the wheel on their tech stack.     
Stay tuned, application link coming soon. 
   
## IRL conversations
*Disclaimer: I live in New York, so this list is very biased.*

3. **Pepper Community** (NYC)   
*What is it:* NYC’s spiciest healthcare community with 500+ founders, operators and investors that lean early startup, organized by [Rohan Siddhanti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-siddhanti-61773033/).

4. **Ash Wellness Happy Hour** (NYC)

Meet ups include happy hour and roundtable conversation on big topics like how to sell into healthtech orgs through channel partnerships.    
*Why I love it:* Sometimes, I’m not sure what I’m getting out of a happy hour. There’s a definite purpose to these GTM Meet Ups, with thoughtful facilitators and discussion.
