As a first-time founder or operator, itâ€™s extremely opaque as to how you raise venture capital (VC) for your company. This especially hits for first-time founders and operators whoâ€™ve never done it before, who donâ€™t have the VC network built in, or the badges like an Ivy League education or FAANG company listed on their resumÃ©.

I have a unique perspective on fundraising, having never been a founder myself. What I have experienced is fundraising through the lens of an operator â€” a Chief of Staff at Capable Health â€” where I worked with our founder and CEO to stand up our fundraising process â€” from putting together our pitch story and data room, to setting up our CRM and lining up all the meetings.

## Why do you even want VC investment?

â€‹â€‹VCs firms or funds invest in early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake in the company. The goal is that this equity will generate a financial return when the company reaches that liquidity event.

Letâ€™s be clear: taking VC money isnâ€™t the right path for every business. It means youâ€™re looking for exponential growth in a short period of time. The worldâ€™s biggest companies including FAANG started with funding and advice from VCs, and venture-backed companies constitute nearly half of IPOs in the U.S.

Thereâ€™s 2 main reasons you take money from a VC:

1. The biggest advantage of working with venture capital firms is that if your startup goes under â€” as most do â€” youâ€™re not on the hook for the money because unlike a loan, thereâ€™s no obligation to pay it back.
2. VCs come to the table with a lot of business and institutional knowledge. Theyâ€™re also well-connected with other businesses that could help you and your startups, professionals that you might want to take on as employees, and â€” obviously â€” other investors.

Usually, youâ€™re ready to raise VC money when you have an idea or prototype, early customers and users who can vouch for you, and your co-founder in place.
