Two years ago, my Dad was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and put on an infusion therapy plan. My Dad made the long drive back and forth every month to the infusion center, sitting in a crowded room for three hours at a time. The experience was miserable and so were his side effects. But what we hadn't expected were the hurdles he encountered *outside* of his appointments. The weeks he waited to hear back on the referral. The back and forths between providers as they got the appropriate paperwork and prior authorization approvals in place. The missed phone calls to play scheduling Tetris. And the pages of medical jargon that left my Dad — who speaks English as a second language — confused and scared.

As someone who's spent my career building and investing in healthcare startups, helping my Dad navigate his infusion treatments led me down a rabbit hole to understand how we can leverage technology to improve the infusion experience — to be more affordable, efficient, and better for patients.

## New Year, more infusions, more effiencies

My Dad's not alone. In 2024, more than 3.2 million Americans received infusion therapy.

Infusion providers are increasingly becoming an essential backbone for our complex and aging population, driven by a rise in chronic conditions that require specialty medications delivered through infusion therapy. There’s been a continued shift to and growth of *outpatient* infusion centers — an alternative to hospital-based infusions — that meet consumers’ demands for comfort and convenience, and payers’ desires for cost-effective site of care. 

In this changing landscape, infusion providers are seeing new opportunities. I've talked to 20 infusion provider leaders over the past few months, and 80% mentioned they are acutely reconsidering their operational strategies in 2025, driven by downward margin pressures in payer rate decreases, increased labor costs, and new advancements in technology and AI. 

But it can be hard to know where to start, in finding and comparing value propositions of new and incumbent tech vendors. 

## Opportunities to "infuse" tech into infusion operations

**To solve this, I built a free resource for infusion provider leaders to find tech vendors.** Currently, there are 45+ vendors listed, vetted for their ability to impact providers’ bottom lines, drive new revenue, and ultimately help provide more, sustainable, quality patient care. 

I also wanted to highlight three priority areas of opportunity for infusion providers to invest in optimizing, in delivering timely, appropriate, and cost-effective infusion care in 2025. Infusion providers should evaluate these opportunities and vendors when looking to:

1. **Get patients from referral to infusion faster and cheaper**
- Vendor categories: Referral management, Prior authorization
2. **Reduce the overhead costs of their contact centers without sacrificing quality**
- Vendor categories: Contact center, Patient scheduling
3. **Flip downward rate pressures from payers**
- Vendor categories: Payer rate transparency, Payer contracting
