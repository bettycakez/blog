## The nuclear family is dead

The “nuclear family” was coined by Bronisław Malinowski, considered the father of social anthropology. He argued for the universal centrality of a biological family that looked something like this: 

![Quintessential nuclear family](/img/nuclear_family_image.jpeg)

Well, not anymore.

While the family is still the fundamental building block of society, millennials are rewriting the parenting playbook to form modern families. In the modern family, women and parents are demanding agency: The power to choose whether they want to have kids, how and where to give birth, where to go for flexible child care… the list goes on. (To butcher Tolstoy, “All nuclear families are alike; each modern family is modern in their own way.”)

There’s an outsized opportunity to build and invest in the infrastructure, products and services that enable this agency. You’re seeing it already. If you’re not ready for kids just yet, you can order contraceptives conveniently online through an e-prescription brand. If you’re deciding on a home birth, you can sign up for a virtual consult with a midwife to walk you through options. If an urgent meeting comes up and you need child care ASAP, you can search through a child care marketplace for open spots at a center nearby. 

I call this market “Family Tech.” And we’re only at the early innings of innovating in it.

## Mapping out the $46B Family Tech market

This article is my primer on Family Tech, a new wave of tech-enabled products and services that are empowering millennial women and parents to care for the modern family. I’m taking you along with me as I map out the [$46B](https://www.betterventures.io/post/6-trends-not-to-miss-as-parent-tech-founder) (and growing) Family Tech market. We’ll break down why now; the stages, categories, and companies that are paving the way in the market; and why you should care as a builder or investor.

### So, why exactly now?

1. **There are more Americans then ever who’re making (or about to make) family planning decisions**. Millennials (ages 26 to 41) represent America’s largest generation. They also happen to be the target demographic for Family Tech, as they’re both digitally savvy and of reproductive age. Right after Millennials come Gen Zs (ages 10 to 25), and together, they bring a new set of considerations to family planning ranging from [climate change to student debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/millennials-and-generation-z-members-are-going-public-with-their-reluctance-to-have-children-01662499330). There's new opportunity to build Family Tech for these generations' unique pain points. 
2. **Tech adoption has increased the standard of family care**. Let’s face it, we live on our smartphones. Spurred on by the pandemic where we saw a [15x increase](https://www.gao.gov/blog/telehealth-pandemic-how-has-it-changed-health-care-delivery-medicaid-and-medicare#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20the%20number,GAO's%20Medicaid%20expert%2C%20Carolyn%20Yocom.) in the usage of telehealth services, consumers now expect virtual-first care and a personalized, high-touch digital health experience. Consumers are more open than ever about adopting Family Tech. 
3. **Government policies and agendas are shining a spotlight on reproductive and child care rights**. All big trends in healthcare are driven by regulation, and Family Tech is no different. Notably, the Dobbs decision has restricted abortion across the nation and created [an urgent need](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2022/06/30/dobbs-another-frontline-for-health-equity/) for access to reproductive health care. And while it ultimately failed to pass, Biden administration's Build Back Better Act promised to cap child care costs [at 7% of families' income](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/), spotlighting a white space opportunity for affordable, high-quality child care. 
4. **Family Tech rides on the tailwinds of women’s health investments**. “FemTech” is a well-trodden, buzzworthy [$38B](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/05/10/2439959/0/en/Global-Women-s-Health-Market-was-valued-at-38-billion-in-2021-and-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-over-4-5-to-cross-47-billion-by-2026.html) market with unicorns like Maven Clinic and Tia as shining exemplars of why invest in the space. Investors already have their checkbooks open for women's health companies deploying [$1.3B](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/femtech-startups-nearly-double-funding-dollars-last-year-still-make-small-percent-market) in funding last year, and they've dug deep with comprehensive theses including [this one](https://m13.co/article/how-femtech-innovations-can-help-break-taboos-around-womens-health) by Winnie Lau for M13 and [this one](https://rockhealth.com/insights/building-comprehensive-women-digital-health-eight-sectors-serving-women-needs/) by Rock Health. The buzz around FemTech has opened the door for Family Tech, too. 

While Family Tech is deeply intertwined with the woman’s outsized role as the child bearer and oftentimes primary caregiver, it also encompasses a broader swathe of innovations. Family Tech includes tech-enabled products and services used by parents across the entire continuum of care: family planning, child bearing, child rearing, and child launching. 

![Stages of parenting](/img/stages_of_parenting.png)

I’ve mapped out the Family Tech market across these four stages of parenthood, representing 26 categories and 175+ companies building to care for the modern family.

## Family planning
![Family planning market map](/img/family_planning_market_map.png)

*What is it:* The modern family starts out with family planning. Whether you’re single or in a relationship, individuals are looking to plan out and control how many children they want (if any) and when they have them. 

*Why you should care:* There are more millennial women of childbearing age in the U.S. than ever. Yet, birth and fertility rates are at an [all time low](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44151642) and the median age of women giving birth has been pushed back to [30 years old](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/motherhood-deferred-us-median-age-giving-birth-hits-30-rcna27827), a record high. Turns out, women and millennials are choosing to focus on their careers and education and delaying childbirth. Families are also being formed differently, with single individuals and same-sex couples wanting the option to have children. 

This has fueled new family planning technologies that surface data-driven insights for you to make better family planning decisions, help you stop or increase the chances of pregnancy affordably and accessibly, and give you the longitudinal support and guidance through your fertility journey. 

Family planning has garnered tons of investments over the past decade under the banner of FemTech, with the fertility market being worth [$8B](https://www.evicore.com/insights/next-for-the-fertility-market) (10% CAGR) and received [$345M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/fertility-support-startups-banked-345m-funding-2021-heres-why-workplace-perk-becoming#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20fertility%20support%20startups,fund%20dedicated%20to%20digital%20health.) of VC funding in 2021 alone.

## Child bearing
![Child bearing market map](/img/child_bearing_market_map.png)

*What is it:* Congrats, you’re pregnant! The pregnancy and postpartum period, which averages 40 weeks and 6 weeks respectively, is when the expecting parents carry and give birth to their children. 

*Why you should care:* There’s a maternity care ‘desert,’ where [36% of U.S. counties](https://patientengagementhit.com/news/a-third-of-us-counties-a-maternity-care-access-desert#:~:text=Overall%2C%2036%20percent%20of%20US,born%20in%20maternity%20care%20deserts.) have no obstetric hospitals or birth centers, and no obstetric providers. Combined with women giving birth later in life which correlates with [more severe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-age-complications/severe-birth-complications-more-common-with-older-mothers-idUSKBN18Q28T) birth complications, there’s actually been an increase in maternal deaths in the U.S. with [23.8 deaths](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/health/us-women-health-care/index.html#:~:text=The%20US%20had%20the%20highest,deaths%20per%20100%2C000%20live%20births.) out of 100,000 births in 2020. An even more sobering stat: the maternal mortality rate was double amongst Black women. 

There are big opportunities to improve the physical and emotional health of expecting parents and their children by providing longitudinal care, support, and education during pregnancy and postpartum, including to nutrition and mental health services.

In the U.S., maternal and infant health care is a [$160B industry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/business/mahmee-goldman-sachs-maternal-health/index.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1667975929376117&usg=AOvVaw0ApIfPBRKSxMKTxar0w-cu) with billions of dollars yet to be unlocked.

*Categories to watch:* 
- **Prenatal nutrition** companies like [Needed](https://thisisneeded.com/) and [WeNatal](https://wenatal.com/) help mothers stay well-nourished through pregnancy and lactation with consumer-friendly supplements, vitamins and nutritional guidance.
- **Pregnancy & postpartum care** solutions like [Koble](https://koblecares.com/), [Cayaba Care](https://cayabacare.com/) and [Oula](https://oulahealth.com/) provide telehealth, educational resources, and personalized guidance through the entire pregnancy journey, including between OB/GYN visits.

## Child rearing
![Child rearing market map](/img/child_rearing_market_map.png)

*What is it:* Raising your child from infancy to adolescence — the ages of 1 to 12 years old — is the next big mountain to climb. Your child will take their first steps, learn to speak, start school, and inevitably have a few health scares that you’ll need to go to the pediatrician for. 

*Why you should care:* Raising a child is a hands-on, difficult process: 5.6 million children in the U.S. required at least 5 hours of in-home medical care, [one in six](https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20190318childmentalillness.html#:~:text=After%20excluding%20children%20without%20current,depression%2C%20anxiety%20or%20ADHD).) children have a mental or behavioral health disorder, and let’s not forget [this summer’s baby formula shortage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/us/baby-formula-shortage.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1667976268952922&usg=AOvVaw00UhdNtT2f7cjy1o93AE9B) leaving parents scrambling to find nutrition supplements. Parents are likely doing all this while balancing a full-time job — [more than half](https://www.zippia.com/advice/us-child-care-availability-statistics/#:~:text=58%25%20of%20working%20parents%20rely%20on%20child%20care%20centers.,the%20National%20Household%20Education%20Survey.) of working parents rely on child care centers yet the cost of child care has risen by [41%](https://fortune.com/2022/01/28/the-cost-of-child-care-in-the-us-is-rising/) during the pandemic.

Companies supporting child rearing can help parents care for all their children’s needs proactively, with convenient and affordable childcare, infant nutrition, and pediatric healthcare services. 

American mothers have incredible spending power — estimated at [$2.4T](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaklich/2019/05/10/the-new-mom-economy-meet-the-startups-disrupting-the-46-billion-millennial-parenting-market/?sh=18abe4251304#110978155130) and 85% of household purchases. They’re often the key decision maker for companies who’re gunning for a slide of the pie at this child rearing stage: baby infant formula is a [$3.9B](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/15/2463074/0/en/U-S-Baby-Infant-Formula-Market-Is-Expected-to-Reach-6-78-Billion-by-2030-Says-AMR.html) market and child care is a [$33B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-child-care-market) market in the U.S. alone.

*Categories to watch:*
- **Infant nutrition** startups like [Helaina](https://www.myhelaina.com/), [Nara Organics](https://naraorganics.com/) and [Persephone Biosciences](https://www.persephonebiosciences.com/) are researching and developing alternative infant formula, and startups like [MilkStork](https://www.milkstork.com/) and [Bobbie](https://www.hibobbie.com/) are making infant nutrition convenient with DTC delivery.
- **Child care** providers are optimizing for flexibility with on-demand marketplace platforms matching parents with child care like [WeeCare](https://weecare.co/), [Kinside](https://www.kinside.com/child-care-providers), and [Otter](https://withotter.com/), and with well-designed, brick-and-mortar childcare centers like [Vivvi](https://vivvi.com/).
- **Pediatric behavioral & mental health** solutions are on the rise with Little Otter and Cartwheel Care meeting children where they are — including at schools and virtually. 
- **Pediatric & urgent care** services like Brave Care and Summer Health are providing personalized, virtual-first pediatric and urgent care.

## Child launching
![Child launching market map](/img/child_launching_market_map.png)

*What is it:* From the ages of 12 to 25, you’re helping your child transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Adolescents are going through puberty, explore their own identify and gaining independence. Often, this means your role as a parent goes from the primary decision maker for your child’s health decisions, to being a supportive guide and safety net. 

*Why you should care:* Adolescence is a critical time for promoting health, and one that is sometimes overlooked. There are [42M](https://opa.hhs.gov/adolescent-health/adolescent-health-facts/americas-diverse-adolescents) adolescents in the U.S., and amongst them, [only half](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-11-09/us-adolescents-are-getting-less-sex-education-now-than-25-years-ago) are receiving sex education that meet national standards and [13%](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/05/03/american-teens-are-experiencing-a-rise-in-mental-health-disorders-suicidal-thoughts/#:~:text=From%202007%20to%202019%2C%20the,to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center.) having a major depressive episode (a 60 percent increase from 2007). In addition, adolescents and young adults make up [95%](https://www.eatingdisordercenter.org/facts-figures/#:~:text=95%25%20of%20those%20who%20have,with%20eating%20disorders%20receive%20treatment.) of people with eating disorders and [43%](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/science/transgender-teenagers-national-survey.html) of the trangender population.

Child launching innovations provide adolescents — and their parents as guardians and supporters — with high-touch services and information to take care of their whole self: from mental and behavioral health, to sexual and physical health. These Gen Zs are digital natives, so the bar is high for bold brands and delightful mobile-first experiences.

If VC funding is any any indication, this market is ripe for disruption: digital behavioral health tools for children and teenagers reached [$919M](https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/31/digital-mental-health-children-teens-data/) in 2021, up from $51 million in 2017 (that’s 17x).

*Categories to watch:*
- **Adolescent mental & behavioral health** services for adolescents and young adults like [Mantra Health](https://www.mantrahealth.com/) and [Charlie Health](https://www.charliehealth.com/) are addressing the adolescent mental health crisis with high-touch community support. 
- **Adolescent primary & urgent care** services for adolescent and young adults are bringing convenient and affordable services to where they are; in the case of [Caraway](https://www.caraway.health/) and [Thread Health](https://threadhealth.com/), at college and through text message. 
- **Eating disorder** treatments like [Equip](https://equip.health/) and [Arise](https://www.wearise.com/) are providing adolescents and young adults — who make up 95% of people with eating disorders — with at-home care coordination and care. 
- **Gender-affirming care** like [Plume](https://getplume.co/) and [FOLX Health](https://www.folxhealth.com/) that offer are critical for this age group as individuals under 25 make up 43% of the transgender population.
- **Adolescent health education** companies like [Blume](https://www.blume.com) and [AllBodies](https://allbodies.com/) provide engaging, digital sex education courses and other wellness resources.

## Let’s build to care for the modern family, together

While the nuclear family is dead, the modern family is thriving. Millennial women and individuals who’re looking for agency and choice across the care continuum — from family planning to child launching — are turning to Family Tech. Ultimately, these tech-enabled products and services are a $46B and growing opportunity to build and invest in bettering the health outcomes of women, mothers, parents, children, and families. 

And that’s why Family Tech is deeply personal to me. I’m the [Chief of Staff](http://www.capablehealth.com/) at Capable Health where we provide Family Tech builders with the software infrastructure for modern care delivery, and a Venture Fellow at [Susa Ventures](http://www.susaventures.com/) where we invest in early-stage Family Tech founders. But I'm also a millennial woman who’s starting to assess her own family planning options.

We're just getting started. While this article set the scene on the Family Tech space, there’s tons to unpack. I’ll be diving into a few categories over the next months to break down trends and white space opportunities I'm excited about. Subscribe below to get notified. 

Over the next few months, I’m going to dive into a few Family Tech categories to break down trends I’m bullish on, and white space opportunities I’m seeing in the market. Subscribe below to get notified.
