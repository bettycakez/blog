*Author’s note: Hello! This article serves as a primer on Family Tech, a new wave of tech-enabled products and services that give women, individuals, and parents the agency to care for their modern families. I make the case for how the traditional nuclear family has given way to different and diverse family models — which I call the modern family — and that now’s the right time to build and invest in the Family Tech enabling this paradigm shift. I’ll break down the stages, categories, and companies that are paving the way in Family Tech; and why you should care as a builder or investor. TL DR;*

## The nuclear family is dead, long live the modern family

The “nuclear family” was coined by Bronisław Malinowski, considered the father of social anthropology. He argued for the universal centrality of a biological family that looked something like this:

![Quintessential nuclear family](/img/nuclear_family_image.jpeg)

This term became popularized after World War II as a description of the standard family structure. There was the breadwinner male, his wife who did household chores and looked after the children, and the children themselves. There was an order in which this structure typically took form, too: the man and woman got married, moved in together, had sex, then had children — all before their mid-20s. The nuclear family was the core unit of society well into the 70’s.

Well, not anymore.

While the family is still the fundamental building block of society, millennials are rewriting the parenting playbook to form modern families. Unlike the nuclear family that had one singular blueprint for the family model, modern families take on many different shapes and forms — from single-parent and childless families, to same-sex couples and parents raising transgender kids. The main characteristic of the modern family is agency: Women, individuals and parents want to have the power to choose whether to have kids, how and where to give birth, where to go for flexible child care… the list goes on. (To butcher Tolstoy, “All nuclear families are alike; each modern family is modern in their own way.”) 

With this paradigm shift in the family model, the healthcare and caregiving solutions have shifted as well to be more individualized, specialized, and personalized. You’re seeing it already. If you’re not ready for kids just yet, you can get contraceptives prescribed and delivered online. If you’re deciding on a home birth, you can sign up for a virtual consult with a midwife to walk you through options. If an urgent meeting comes up and you need child care ASAP, you can search through a child care marketplace for open spots at a center nearby.

**There’s an outsized opportunity to build and invest in this new wave of tech-enabled products and services that give individuals and parents the agency to care for their modern families. This category is called Family Tech, a [$46B](https://www.betterventures.io/post/6-trends-not-to-miss-as-parent-tech-founder) and growing opportunity, and we’re in the early days of it.**

## Mapping out the $46B Family Tech opportunity

Family Tech is not just a big opportunity; it's one that’s deeply personal to me. 

I’m lucky enough to have met and partnered with incredible Family Tech founders and builders through my work, as the Chief of Staff at [Capable Health](http://www.capablehealth.com/) where we provide the software infrastructure for modern (family) care delivery, and as a Venture Fellow at [Susa Ventures](http://www.susaventures.com/) where we back exceptional Family Tech founders. I’m also a millennial woman who’s starting to assess her own family planning options.

To understand the Family Tech market as it is today, I’ve mapped it out across four stages of parenting for us to dive into together: family planning, child bearing, child rearing, and child launching. We’ll identify the categories and companies that are paving the way in each, and why builders and investors should care.

But firstly, you may be asking the age-old question, “Why now?” There are four major tailwinds that’re enabling the paradigm shift towards the modern family and Family Tech:

1. **There are more Americans then ever who’re making (or about to make) family planning decisions.** Millennials (ages 26 to 41) represent America’s largest generation. They also happen to be the target demographic for Family Tech, as they’re both digitally savvy and of reproductive age. Right after Millennials come Gen Zs (ages 10 to 25), and together, they bring a new set of considerations to the modern family, ranging from [climate change to student debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/millennials-and-generation-z-members-are-going-public-with-their-reluctance-to-have-children-01662499330). That’s new opportunity to build Family Tech for these generations’ unique pain points and perspectives.

2. **Consumers have adopted tech en masse and have higher standards for care than ever.** Let’s face it, we’re hooked to our smartphones. Spurred on by the pandemic where we saw a [15x increase](https://www.gao.gov/blog/telehealth-pandemic-how-has-it-changed-health-care-delivery-medicaid-and-medicare#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20the%20number,GAO%27s%20Medicaid%20expert%2C%20Carolyn%20Yocom.) in the usage of telehealth services, consumers now expect virtual-first care that’s personalized, convenient, and high-touch. Consumers are more open than ever about adopting Family Tech.

3. **Government agendas are shining a spotlight on reproductive, maternal and child care rights.** All big trends in healthcare are driven by legislation and regulation, and Family Tech is no different. Notably, the Dobbs decision has created [an urgent need](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2022/06/30/dobbs-another-frontline-for-health-equity/) for access to reproductive health care. CMS has been pushing states to provide postpartum coverage for 12 months to people enrolled in [Medicaid and CHIP](https://patientengagementhit.com/news/medicaid-policies-fuel-disparities-in-timely-prenatal-care-access). And while it ultimately failed to pass, the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act promised to cap child care costs at [7% of families’ income](https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/). Government agendas have spotlighted white space opportunities for the modern family.

4. **Family Tech rides on the tailwinds of women’s health investments.** “FemTech” is a well-trodden, buzzworthy [$38B](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/05/10/2439959/0/en/Global-Women-s-Health-Market-was-valued-at-38-billion-in-2021-and-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-over-4-5-to-cross-47-billion-by-2026.html) market with unicorns like Maven Clinic and Tia as shining exemplars of why invest in the space. Investors already have their checkbooks open for women’s health companies, deploying [$1.3B](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/femtech-startups-nearly-double-funding-dollars-last-year-still-make-small-percent-market) in funding last year, and they’ve dug deep with comprehensive theses including [this one](https://m13.co/article/how-femtech-innovations-can-help-break-taboos-around-womens-health) by Winnie Lau for M13 and [this one](https://rockhealth.com/insights/building-comprehensive-women-digital-health-eight-sectors-serving-women-needs/) by Rock Health. Family Tech is deeply intertwined with women’s health given the important role women have as the child bearer and oftentimes primary caregiver. The buzz around FemTech has opened the door for Family Tech, too.

Now, let’s jump into the first stage of parenting…

### Family planning
![Family planning market map](/img/family_planning_market_map.png)

The modern family starts out with family planning. Whether single or in a relationship, individuals are looking to plan out and control how many children they want (if any) and when they have them. 

*Why you should care:* There are more millennial women of childbearing age in the U.S. than ever. Yet, birth and fertility rates are at an [all time low](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44151642) and the median age of women giving birth has been pushed back to [30 years old](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/motherhood-deferred-us-median-age-giving-birth-hits-30-rcna27827), a record high. Turns out, women and millennials are choosing to focus on their careers and education and delaying childbirth. Families also look physically different than they used to, with single individuals and same-sex couples wanting the options to have children. 

This has fueled new technologies that capture and surface insights to make informed family planning decisions, stop or increase the chances of pregnancy affordably and accessibly, open up alternative pathways to having a child, and provide longitudinal support and guidance through the end-to-end fertility journey. 

The fertility market is one of the most active spaces in Family Tech with [$8B](https://www.evicore.com/insights/next-for-the-fertility-market) (10% CAGR) and receiving [$345M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/fertility-support-startups-banked-345m-funding-2021-heres-why-workplace-perk-becoming#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20fertility%20support%20startups,fund%20dedicated%20to%20digital%20health.) of VC funding in 2021 alone.

### Child bearing
![Child bearing market map](/img/child_bearing_market_map.png)

Congrats, you’re pregnant! The pregnancy and postpartum period, which averages 40 weeks and 6 weeks respectively, is when the expecting parents carry and give birth. 

*Why you should care:* There’s a maternity care ‘desert,’ where [36% of U.S. counties](https://patientengagementhit.com/news/a-third-of-us-counties-a-maternity-care-access-desert#:~:text=Overall%2C%2036%20percent%20of%20US,born%20in%20maternity%20care%20deserts.) have no obstetric hospitals or birth centers, and no obstetric providers. Combined with women giving birth later in life which correlates with [more severe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-age-complications/severe-birth-complications-more-common-with-older-mothers-idUSKBN18Q28T) birth complications, there’s actually been an [increase in maternal deaths in the U.S.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/health/us-women-health-care/index.html#:~:text=The%20US%20had%20the%20highest,deaths%20per%20100%2C000%20live%20births.) An even more sobering stat is the disproportionate effects on racial and ethnic minorities: the maternal mortality rate was double amongst Black women. 

There are critical gaps that Family Tech can help fill around longitudinal care, support and education during pregnancy and postpartum, to improve the physical, mental and emotional health of expecting parents. 

In the U.S., maternal and infant health care is a [$160B industry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/business/mahmee-goldman-sachs-maternal-health/index.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1667975929376117&usg=AOvVaw0ApIfPBRKSxMKTxar0w-cu) with billions of dollars yet to be unlocked.

*Categories to watch:* 
- **Prenatal nutrition** companies like [Needed](https://thisisneeded.com/) and [WeNatal](https://wenatal.com/) help mothers stay well-nourished through pregnancy and lactation with consumer-friendly supplements, vitamins and nutritional guidance.
- **Pregnancy & postpartum care** solutions like [Koble](https://koblecares.com/), [Cayaba Care](https://cayabacare.com/) and [Oula](https://oulahealth.com/) offer end-to-end services for a personalized pregnancy journey that spans beyond OB/GYN visits, including tailored educational resources, and virtual support from doulas, midwives and coaches.

### Child rearing
![Child rearing market map](/img/child_rearing_market_map.png)

Taking care of your child from infancy to adolescence — the ages of 1 to 12 years old — is the next big mountain to climb. It's the critical period in a child's development where they take their first steps, learn to speak, start school, and inevitably have many checkups with the pediatrician. 

*Why you should care:* It's harder and [more expensive than ever](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/08/30/its-getting-more-expensive-to-raise-children-and-government-isnt-doing-much-to-help/#:~:text=It%20now%20costs%20more%20to%20raise%20a%20child&text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20has%20now,to%20the%20age%20of%2017.) to raise a child. Children need a lot of care — at least 5.6M children require >5 hours of in-home medical care, and [1 in 6](https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20190318childmentalillness.html#:~:text=After%20excluding%20children%20without%20current,depression%2C%20anxiety%20or%20ADHD).) have been diagnosed with a mental or behavioral health disorder. Yet there's been big hurdles to overcome like [this summer’s baby formula shortage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/us/baby-formula-shortage.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1667976268952922&usg=AOvVaw00UhdNtT2f7cjy1o93AE9B) leaving parents scrambling to find nutrition supplements and the cost of child care rising by [41%](https://fortune.com/2022/01/28/the-cost-of-child-care-in-the-us-is-rising/) during the pandemic.

Family Tech at the child rearing stage help busy parents take care of their children proactively and affordably, with flexible childcare, infant nutrition, and pediatric healthcare services. 

American mothers make the decision for 85% of household purchases and have incredible spending power — estimated at [$2.4T](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaklich/2019/05/10/the-new-mom-economy-meet-the-startups-disrupting-the-46-billion-millennial-parenting-market/?sh=18abe4251304#110978155130). They’re often the key decision maker for companies who’re gunning for a slice of the pie at this child rearing stage: baby infant formula is a [$3.9B](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/15/2463074/0/en/U-S-Baby-Infant-Formula-Market-Is-Expected-to-Reach-6-78-Billion-by-2030-Says-AMR.html) market and child care is a [$33B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-child-care-market) market in the U.S.

*Categories to watch:*
- **Infant nutrition** startups like [Helaina](https://www.myhelaina.com/), [Nara Organics](https://naraorganics.com/) and [Persephone Biosciences](https://www.persephonebiosciences.com/) are researching and developing alternative infant formula, and startups like [MilkStork](https://www.milkstork.com/) and [Bobbie](https://www.hibobbie.com/) are making infant nutrition convenient with DTC delivery.
- **Child care** providers are optimizing for flexibility with on-demand marketplace platforms matching parents with child care like [WeeCare](https://weecare.co/), [Kinside](https://www.kinside.com/child-care-providers), and [Otter](https://withotter.com/), and with well-designed, brick-and-mortar childcare centers like [Vivvi](https://vivvi.com/).
- **Pediatric behavioral & mental health** solutions are on the rise with [Little Otter](https://www.littleotterhealth.com/) and [Cartwheel Care](https://www.cartwheelcare.org/) meeting children where they are, including at schools and virtually. 
- **Pediatric & urgent care** services like [Brave Care](https://bravecare.com/) and [Summer Health](https://www.summerhealth.com/) are providing personalized, virtual-first pediatric and urgent care.

### Child launching
![Child launching market map](/img/child_launching_market_map.png)

From the ages of 12 to 25, you’re helping your child transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Adolescents are going through puberty, explore their own identity and seeking autonomy. Often, this means that a parent's role goes from being the primary decision maker for purchasing decisions, to being a supportive guide and safety net as their child becomes fully independent. 

*Why you should care:* Adolescence is a critical coming-of-age period, and one that is often overlooked because of taboo and stigma. There are [42M](https://opa.hhs.gov/adolescent-health/adolescent-health-facts/americas-diverse-adolescents) adolescents in the U.S., and amongst them, [only half](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-11-09/us-adolescents-are-getting-less-sex-education-now-than-25-years-ago) are receiving sex education that meet national standards, [13%](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/05/03/american-teens-are-experiencing-a-rise-in-mental-health-disorders-suicidal-thoughts/#:~:text=From%202007%20to%202019%2C%20the,to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center.) have a major depressive episode, and adolescents and young adults make up [95%](https://www.eatingdisordercenter.org/facts-figures/#:~:text=95%25%20of%20those%20who%20have,with%20eating%20disorders%20receive%20treatment.) of people with eating disorders. As they explore different roles and attitudes, this has also means finding their gender identity as adolescents represent [43%](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/science/transgender-teenagers-national-survey.html) of the trangender population.

Child launching innovations provide adolescents — and their parents as guardians and supporters — with high-touch services and information to take care of their whole self: from mental and behavioral health, to sexual and physical health. These Gen Zs are digital natives, so the bar is high for bold brands and delightful mobile-first experiences.

While still nascent compared to the other stages, investors are starting to take notice: digital behavioral health tools for children and teenagers raked in [$919M](https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/31/digital-mental-health-children-teens-data/) of funding in 2021, up from $51 million in 2017 (that’s 17x).

*Categories to watch:*
- **Adolescent mental & behavioral health** services for adolescents and young adults like [Mantra Health](https://www.mantrahealth.com/) and [Charlie Health](https://www.charliehealth.com/) are addressing the adolescent mental health crisis with high-touch community support. 
- **Adolescent primary & urgent care** services for adolescent and young adults are bringing convenient and affordable services to where they are; in the case of [Caraway](https://www.caraway.health/) and [Thread Health](https://threadhealth.com/), at college and through text message. 
- **Eating disorder** treatments like [Equip](https://equip.health/) and [Arise](https://www.wearise.com/) are providing adolescents and young adults — who make up 95% of people with eating disorders — with at-home care coordination and care. 
- **Gender-affirming care** like [Plume](https://getplume.co/) and [FOLX Health](https://www.folxhealth.com/) that offer are critical for this age group as individuals under 25 make up 43% of the transgender population.
- **Adolescent health education** companies like [Blume](https://www.blume.com) and [AllBodies](https://allbodies.com/) provide engaging, digital sex ed courses and other wellness resources.
